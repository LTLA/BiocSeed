Package: BiocSeed
Version: 0.99.0
Date: 2020-11-13
Description: 
    Implements an intelligent seed-setting mechanism for use with algorithms
    that are practically stochastic but theoretically deterministic. The aim
    is to ensure that functions can return deterministic output without the
    user having to remember to set the seed explicitly; yet avoid using a 
    constant seed that might lock a function into a bad initialization; and
    to also avoid interfering with any set.seed() calls that are provided.

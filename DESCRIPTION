Title: Setting the Random Seed in Bioconductor Packages
License: MIT 
Description: 
    Implements a data-dependent seed-setting mechanism for use within functions
    containing a stochastic component. The aim is to ensure that such functions
    can return deterministic output without the user having to remember to set
    the seed explicitly; yet avoid using a constant seed that might lock a
    function into a bad initialization; and to also avoid interfering with any
    set.seed() calls that are provided.
